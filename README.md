# My First Simple Android App using Kotlin
This app is Guessing the Number game 
this allows to guess the numbers from 1 to 25 just a normal game and specifies the number of guesses 
If the user types a letter or a word it shows that the character should be a number
If the use types greater than 25 then it shows it must be between 1 and 25
The app has the random number previously and shows too high if number is greater and too low if number is smaller 
It allows the game to start over at any moment of the game 
After the game is over the submit button is disabled
After guessing the correct number it shows the number of guesses 

The steps of coding are as follows 
At the first declare the variables then writing code for numbers to come in 1 to 25 
Arranging the Text and buttons in correct position using androidstudio application
writing the code for button when to enable and when is the disable
writing code for telling number of guesses
writing code for number is too high or low 
writing code for showing correct guess of number 
writing code for randomising the number between 1 to 25 each time after pressing startover button
writing code for not detecting word or number greater than 25 and showing message of guess must be from 1 to 25

 

The requirements for creating this app are,
Androidstudio application
knowledge of Kotlin language or Java
Appetize.io web page for online running of the app
